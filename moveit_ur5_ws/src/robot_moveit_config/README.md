# UR5e Robot with 2F-140 Robotiq Gripper MoveIt Configuration

This repository contains the configuration files for the UR5e robot arm with a 2F-140 Robotiq gripper, generated using the MoveIt Setup Assistant. 

## Introduction

This repository provides all necessary configuration files to control a UR5e robot arm equipped with a 2F-140 Robotiq gripper using MoveIt. These files were generated using the MoveIt Setup Assistant and include URDF, SRDF, kinematics, and controller configurations.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the UR5e robot with the 2F-140 Robotiq gripper in your ROS2 workspace:


1. Navigate to your workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ws_moveit2/src
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaib-Snouber/robot_moveit_config.git
   ```
   
3. Clone this repository: These packages contain the needed configuration files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sohaib-Snouber/UR5e_robotiq_gripper_RViz.git
   ```
   
4. Build your workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ws_moveit2
   colcon build
   ```

5. Source your workspace:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## MoveIt Setup Assistant Configuration

To regenerate these configuration files or to make modifications, use the MoveIt Setup Assistant:

1. **Launch MoveIt Setup Assistant:**
   ```bash
   ross launch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch.py
   ```

2. **Load the URDF file:**
   - In the Setup Assistant, click on "Create New MoveIt Configuration Package".
   - Load your URDF file (e.g., `ur5e_robot.urdf`) which includes both the UR5e robot and the 2F-140 Robotiq gripper.
   - An URDF file can be found in this repository [here](https://github.com/Sohaib-Snouber/UR5e_robotiq_gripper_RViz.git), that is being created from the xacro file of the robot configuration.

3. **Configure the Robot:**
   - Follow the steps to configure the Self-Collision Matrix, Virtual Joints, Planning Groups, Robot Poses, End Effectors, Passive Joints, and the 2F-140 gripper.
   - Generate the SRDF configuration file by specifying the planning groups and robot poses.
   
4. **Generate Configuration Files:**
   - Once all configurations are completed, generate the configuration package. The necessary files (SRDF, kinematics.yaml, controllers.yaml, etc.) will be generated in your chosen directory.

5. **Save the Configuration:**
   - Save the generated configuration files and integrate them into your workspace by replacing the existing ones if necessary.

## Usage

To use the provided configurations, simply launch the demo launch file:

```bash
ros2 launch robot_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

This will start the MoveIt! RViz interface with the UR5e robot and the 2F-140 Robotiq gripper, allowing you to plan and execute motions.

## Acknowledgment
